# Form Design and Validation Practice #3

## Overview
For the project, I was able to utilize my skills in preparing html document that me css styling needs and javascript interactive needs.

I  style the layout using css and javascript to interact with the user during validation of the form.

## What are you proud of about the project?

- My ability to use "If statements" to implement code blocks if a certain condition is met was growth for me.

- I was able to make the design responsive without using media query. I am "max-width and precentage".
